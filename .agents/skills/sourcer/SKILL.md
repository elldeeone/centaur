# Talent Sourcer Agent

Sources candidates from LinkedIn, GitHub, and X/Twitter based on a job description, then generates a Google Sheet with results.

## Workflow

### 1. Parse Job Description

Extract key requirements:
- **Role type** (engineering, product, design, operations, etc.)
- **Seniority level** (junior, senior, staff, principal, etc.)
- **Required skills/technologies**
- **Industry context** (crypto, fintech, AI, etc.)
- **Location preferences** (if any)

### 2. Build Search Strategy

Create searches targeting high-signal profiles:

| Signal | How to Find |
|--------|-------------|
| Elite universities | Search profiles with Stanford, MIT, Caltech, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, CMU, Berkeley, Oxford, Cambridge, etc. |
| High-growth companies | People at early-stage Uber, Stripe, Coinbase, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. before 2016-2018 |
| GitHub activity | Use browser-use to find contributors to relevant repos |
| Twitter/X influence | `ptwittercli search` for people tweeting about relevant topics |

### 3. Location Filtering (Hard Requirement)

**If the job description specifies a location, only include candidates based in that location.**

- Check LinkedIn profile location field
- Check X/Twitter bio for city/region mentions
- Exclude candidates who don't match, regardless of other qualifications
- If JD says "Remote" or has no location, skip this filter

### 4. Candidate Ranking Criteria

**Rank candidates in this priority order:**

1. **Title Correspondence** (25%)
   - How closely does the candidate's current title match the target role?
   - Same function + same level = best match (e.g., "Trade Operations Associate" → "Trade Operations Manager")
   - Same function + different level = good match (e.g., "Senior Engineer" → "Staff Engineer")
   - Different function = poor match, even if skills align (e.g., "Trade Operations Associate" → "CFO" is a poor fit)
   - Weight functional alignment heavily over keyword/skill overlap

2. **Educational Foundation** (20%)
   - Elite university attendance (MIT, Stanford, CMU, Caltech, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Berkeley, Oxford, Cambridge)
   - Consider admissions selectivity (< 10% acceptance = top tier)
   - Note: attendance matters more than graduation

3. **Professional Trajectory** (20%)
   - Impact achieved relative to years of experience
   - 3 years with senior-level impact >>> 7 years at average pace
   - Look for promotions, title progressions, scope expansions

4. **Talent Density of Organizations** (20%)
   - Evaluated **dynamically** — do not rely solely on the static elite list
   - For any company not in the known-elite cache, run the **Company Enrichment** step (see below) to score it
   - Signals: investor quality, funding stage, headcount, engineering reputation
   - Known-elite overrides (always score 20, skip enrichment): Jane Street, Two Sigma, Renaissance, Google Brain, DeepMind, Paradigm, a16z crypto
   - Early employees at hypergrowth startups get bonus points (see Timing Window)

5. **Timing Window** (15%)
   - When did they join high-performers?
   - Uber 2013 > Uber 2017
   - Coinbase 2015 > Coinbase 2020
   - Earlier = higher agency signal

### Company Enrichment (Dynamic Talent Density Evaluation)

When a candidate's company is **not** in the known-elite list, evaluate it dynamically before scoring.
Cache results so each company is only looked up once per sourcing run.

**Step 1 — Web search:**
```bash
call websearch search '{"query":"<company_name> funding round investors headcount site:crunchbase.com OR site:pitchbook.com OR site:techcrunch.com"}'
```

**Step 2 — Extract signals and compute a company talent-density score (0–20):**

| Signal | Points | How to Assess |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Tier-1 VC backing** (Sequoia, a16z, Founders Fund, Paradigm, YC, Benchmark, Accel, Thrive, Ribbit) | +8 | Any tier-1 investor in any round |
| **Tier-2 VC backing** (other well-known VCs not in tier 1) | +4 | Known institutional lead, but not tier-1 |
| **Late-stage or public with strong eng reputation** | +6 | Series C+ or public, known for engineering excellence |
| **Early-stage with strong founding team** | +6 | Pre-Series B, founders from elite companies/schools |
| **Small headcount / high funding ratio** | +4 | < 100 employees with $20M+ raised = selective hiring |
| **Open-source presence** | +2 | Popular OSS projects (1k+ GitHub stars) |

Cap the total at 20. If the web search returns no meaningful results (stealth company, very new), default to a score of 5.

**Step 3 — Cache the result:**
Store `{company_name: {score, investors, headcount, stage, notes}}` in a dict and reuse for all candidates at that company.

**Known-elite cache (skip enrichment, always score 20):**
```python
ELITE_COMPANIES = {
    'jane street', 'two sigma', 'renaissance', 'citadel', 'de shaw',
    'google brain', 'google deepmind', 'deepmind', 'openai', 'anthropic',
    'paradigm', 'a16z crypto',
}
```

**Early-stage bonus companies (score 20 + timing bonus applies):**
```python
EARLY_STAGE_BONUS = {
    'stripe': 2016, 'coinbase': 2017, 'uber': 2014,
    'openai': 2020, 'anthropic': 2023, 'square': 2015,
    'plaid': 2018, 'figma': 2019, 'databricks': 2020,
}
# If candidate joined before the cutoff year, add +5 timing bonus (capped at 20 total for density, timing is separate 15% bucket)
```

### 4. Data Sources & Tools

#### LinkedIn (via browser-use)

```python
from browser_use import Agent, Browser, ChatBrowserUse
import asyncio

async def search_linkedin(query: str):
    browser = Browser(
        cloud_profile_id='paradigm-ai',
        cloud_proxy_country_code='us',
    )

    agent = Agent(
        task=f"""
        1. Navigate to https://www.linkedin.com
        2. Search for: {query}
        3. Filter by: People
        4. For each of the first 20 results, extract:
           - Full name
           - Current job title
           - Current company
           - Location/city
           - LinkedIn profile URL
           - Headline/summary
        5. Return as JSON
        """,
        browser=browser,
        llm=ChatBrowserUse(),
    )

    history = await agent.run(max_steps=50)
    return history.final_result()

asyncio.run(search_linkedin("software engineer stripe coinbase crypto"))
```

#### GitHub (via browser-use)

```python
async def search_github_contributors(repo: str):
    browser = Browser(
        cloud_profile_id='paradigm-ai',
        cloud_proxy_country_code='us',
    )

    agent = Agent(
        task=f"""
        1. Navigate to https://github.com/{repo}/graphs/contributors
        2. For top 30 contributors, extract:
           - GitHub username
           - Number of commits
        3. For each username, visit their profile and extract:
           - Full name (if available)
           - Location
           - Company
           - Email (if public)
           - Twitter handle (if linked)
        4. Return as JSON
        """,
        browser=browser,
        llm=ChatBrowserUse(),
    )

    history = await agent.run(max_steps=100)
    return history.final_result()
```

#### X/Twitter (via ptwittercli)

```bash
# Search for people discussing relevant topics
ptwittercli search "ethereum solidity from:* -filter:replies" -n 100

# Get profiles of influential accounts
ptwittercli user vitalik
ptwittercli followers paradigm -n 200
```

### 5. Email Discovery

Try these methods in order:

1. **GitHub profiles** - Often have public email
2. **Pattern matching** - firstname@company.com, firstname.lastname@company.com
3. **Hunter.io** (via browser-use) - Domain email patterns
4. **Apollo.io** (via browser-use) - Email enrichment

### 6. Output to Google Sheet

Create the sheet with `gsuite sheets create`:

```bash
# Create sheet with proper naming: "Sourcing target list: [role] [date]"
gsuite -a svc_ai@paradigm.xyz sheets create \
  --title "Sourcing target list: Senior Protocol Engineer 2026-02-04" \
  --share "dmccarthy@paradigm.xyz" \
  --role writer
```

**Required columns:**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Name | Full name |
| Title | Current job title |
| Company | Current company/organization |
| LinkedIn | Profile URL |
| Email | Email address (if found) |
| Location | City/geography |
| Score | Ranking score (1-100) |
| Notes | Key signals (university, prior companies, timing) |

Update the sheet with data:

```bash
gsuite -a svc_ai@paradigm.xyz sheets update \
  --spreadsheet-id "<SPREADSHEET_ID>" \
  --range "A1:H100" \
  --values '[["Name","Title","Company","LinkedIn","Email","Location","Score","Notes"],["Jane Doe","Staff Engineer","Stripe","https://linkedin.com/in/janedoe","jane@stripe.com","SF","95","MIT CS, Stripe 2015, ex-Google Brain"]]'
```

## Ideal Candidate Signals

- Extremely articulate communicator, can explain complex ideas in a way that is easy to understand (Strong signal)
- Multiple examples of solving complex problems (Strong signal)
- Followed by multiple people at Paradigm or by Paradigm founders/fellows on X/Twitter (Strong signal)
- Spend less than 1 year in each role over multiple companies (Yellow flag)

## Experience Level & "Juice" Heuristic (Learned from Andromeda VPE search, March 2026)

When sourcing for startup leadership roles (VP/Head of Eng at zero-to-one companies), calibrate for candidates who still have **builder energy**, not just seniority:

- **Sweet spot: ~10–18 years of experience.** Director or early VP level. Senior enough to lead, junior enough to still be hands-on and hungry.
- **Penalize "too senior":** SVPs, CTOs of large companies, or co-founders with 25+ year careers who have bounced across many companies are likely past the zero-to-one stage. They may lack the remaining juice for a startup run.
- **Reward trajectory over tenure:** A director at 12 years experience who has built teams from scratch at 2–3 companies is stronger than a VP at 25 years who climbed ladders at big cos.
- **Startup founding/building DNA matters:** Prior experience co-founding a startup, being a founding engineer, or scaling a team from zero at a high-growth company is a strong signal — even if the startup failed or was acqui-hired.
- **Avoid career bouncers:** 25+ year careers with short stints across many companies suggest a lack of commitment or impact at any single place. Yellow flag.
- **Never suggest duplicates across rounds.** Track previously suggested names and never re-suggest them, even if they were well-received.

## Sourcing Heuristics

- Look for candidates who work at companies funded by the most prestigious VCs (Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund, Y Combinator, etc.)
- Omit anyone who currently works at a Paradigm portfolio company, but use people at companies like Phantom, Uniswap, Zora, Magic Eden, OpenSea, Axiom, Coinbase, Privy, Kalshi, Monad and Coinbase as examples of exceptional talent, with some caveats

## Decision Framework

- Would Dan McCarthy or Chris Shu feel comfortable recommending this candidate to a Paradigm portfolio company?
- Would this person accelerate a portfolio company's trajectory?
- Would we be interested in staying in touch with this person for a future role?

## Tips

- **Parallelize searches** - Run LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter searches concurrently
- **Respect rate limits** - Space out browser-use requests to avoid blocks
- **Dedupe aggressively** - Same person may appear across platforms
- **Verify emails** - Pattern-matched emails should be marked as unverified
- **Prioritize recency** - More recent profiles have more accurate info
